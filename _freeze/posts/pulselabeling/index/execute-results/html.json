How can we know which syllable a pulse appears in? (ie how to label the pulse with the syllable number)\n2. How can we assess a pulse's timestamp relative to the syllable boundaries it occurs in? \n(eg how far into the syllable does the pulse occur)\n\nAs it happens, this problem becomes fairly straightforward when using [non-equi joins](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/perform-a-non-equi-join.php).\nThese are joins (left, right, etc.) that match not merely on equivalence matching,\nbut when more complex logical operations need to be used.\nIn our case, we want to merge information about the pulses and their timestamps\nwith information about the syllable boundary timestamps.\nWe can accomplish this by joining two dataframes based on whether the pulse\ntimestamp is between the start and end timestamps of a particular interval.\n\nIn this post, I'll show how this can be accomplished in R using the new non-equi \njoin functionality added to `{dplyr}` version 1.1.[^vernote]\nIn the process, I'll also show off some tools from the `{rPraat}` package and\nthe `{sosprosody}` package, which I am developing to support the analyses and\ndata processing for my dissertation work.\nThese packages provide some useful functionality for working with PitchTier\nand TextGrid objects from Praat.\nHowever, this functionality can also be accomplished through any non-equi join\nimplementation.\nI'm familiar with the `{fuzzyjoin}` package, and [this post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/02/the-unequalled-joy-of-non-equi-joins/)\nprovides some additional options.\n\n[^vernote]: Dev note: dplyr 1.1 is only needed here for the non-equi joins, the `{sosprosody}`\npackage doesn't require it. There was a change in the behavior of\n`dplyr::summarize` when `dplyr::reframe` was introduced, but `sosprosody` will \ncheck whether `reframe` is exported by the currently installed `dplyr` namespace\nwhen the package is loaded. For the general reader, this means my package will\nwork regardless of version without spitting out numerous warnings if you have\nalready upgraded.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nI am providing some resynthesized files here from my dissertation work, \ncurrently they're not available publicly but will eventually be on the OSF\nas the work is published and presented. \nI won't be discussing the details further in this post, but I'll note that the\nphone labels were returned by the [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n(@mfa) and the syllable labels were hand coded.\n:::\n\n\n## Required packages\n\nSee below code block for installation of the most relevant packages.\n`{dplyr}` must be version 1.1/the development version (as of this writing) to \nallow for non-equi/fuzzy joins, and so is not (yet) part of a typical \ninstallation of tidyverse.[^installnote]\nRefer to below code block for installation.\n\n[^installnote]: If you're having difficulties installing the development version, \nthere's a few things you can try. You can try restarting your R session, try\nseparately updating any dependencies first (I needed to update `vctrs` separately),\ntry removing dplyr entirely (`remove.packages('dplyr')`). If you're on windows\nand getting a permissions issue, try running R/RStudio as an administrator.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# devtools or remotes can be used to install from github\ndevtools::install_github(\"tidyverse/dplyr\")\ninstall.packages('rPRaat')\ndevtools::install_github('tsostarics/sosprosody')\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we'll load the packages we'll be using.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)      # For joins\nlibrary(rPraat)     # Read functions for textgrids and pitch tiers\nlibrary(sosprosody) # Helpers for working with textgrids and pitch tiers\n\n# These two are part of any tidyverse installation\nlibrary(ggplot2)    # For plotting\nlibrary(purrr)      # For mapping functions\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Example with one file\n\nOur goal: Associate each pitch pulse with an interval on a tier from a TextGrid.\n\nThe approach: Non-equi joins.

The\ntimepoints, given by `time_by`, are then used to create a sequence of equally \nspaces values (via `seq(from, to, length.out)`). For each new time value,\nthe corresponding frequency is calculated via linear interpolation of the \nadjacent pulse frequency values given by `.pitchval` (default is `\"hz\"`). This \nis done separately for each group given by `.grouping` (default is `\"file\"`).\n\n[^extract]: Note that `piecewise_extract_pulses` is another similar function, \nbut will not allow for more pulses than what exists in the interval already.\nAdditionally, that function extracts pulses based on modular arithmetic rather\nthan linear interpolation, so any discontinuities are ignored in the result.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsyllable_labeled_df <- \n  label_pitch_pulses(tier = 'syllable') |> \n  dplyr::filter(interval_i != 1) |> \n  rename(syllable = label)\n\nsyllable_labeled_df |> \n  # Get fifty equally spaced pulses for each interval\n  sosprosody::piecewise_interpolate_pulses(section_by = \"syllable\",\n                                           pulses_per_section = 50,\n                                           time_by = \"timepoint\",\n                                           .pitchval = \"hz\",\n                                           .grouping = \"file\") |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = timepoint, y = hz, color= syllable, shape = syllable)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'top') +\n  facet_wrap(~file) +\n  coord_fixed(1/50)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-syllable-labels-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMoreover, `piecewise_interpolate_pulses` can be used to get a certain number\nof pulses *per section*.\nThis allows you to upsample or downsample different parts of the utterance as\nneeded (cf the above example upsampled across the board).\nBelow, I'll get 10 pulses for the first section and 40 pulses for the \nsecond.[^sylnote]\n\n[^sylnote]: Note that because the prenuclear material was associated with an unlabeled tier,\nthe the relevant intervals for the first and second syllables are 2 and 3\ninstead of 1 and 2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsyllable_labeled_df |> \n  # Get different numbers of pulses by interval\n  sosprosody::piecewise_interpolate_pulses(section_by = \"syllable\",\n                                           pulses_per_section = c('1' = 10,\n                                                                  '2' = 40),\n                                           time_by = \"timepoint\",\n                                           .grouping = \"file\") |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = timepoint,\n             y = hz,\n             group = file,\n             color = syllable, \n             shape = syllable)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'top')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/interpolate-by-syllable-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the above plot, we can tell that at least one of the files have a pitch \ncontour that starts a bit later than the others given the raw time on the x\naxis.\nThis arises due to the slightly longer prenuclear material present in that\nutterance (the other two files were resynthesized from the same source file).\nWe can time normalize these files such that the first syllable from each\ncontour is directly comparable, i.e., they'll all start at 0 and end at 1.\nAnd we can do that separately for the second syllable too.\nIt's more typical to time normalize by the duration of an entire word or\nutterance, but we'll work with a more narrow case of time normalizing within\neach syllable.\nWe address this problem with with much of the tools we've already used so far.\nBelow I use the `time_normalize` function from `sosprosody`, which is a \nconvenience wrapper that does the subtraction and division operations for\ntime normalizing.[^timenorm]\n\n[^timenorm]: For those unfamiliar, the general algorithm is: For each interval\n$i$ with boundary timepoints $t_{i,start}$ and $t_{i,end}$, for each pulse in\nthat interval with timepoints $t_{i,j}$, do $t_{i,j}-t_{i,start}$ to get shifted\ntimepoints $t'_{i,j}$.

Or the second?\nPreviously we addressed this in our non-equi join, associating such a point\nwith the first section by joining on $min(sec_t) <= t < max(sec_t)$.\nWe could have associated it with the second section by joining on\n$min(sec_t) < t <= max(sec_t)$.\nBut if we joined on $min(sec_t) <= t <= max(sec_t)$, then the time $t$ at .5\nwould be duplicated, as there would be a point at .5 at the very end of the\nfirst section and another point at .5 at the very start of the second section.\n\nHere's an example of what I mean with three sections.\nWhen all the sections are plotted together,
